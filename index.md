## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

On this page there will be infomrmation about my projects and what I have done to each project. This page will also contain an updated list of languages I am profecient in as well as languages I'm currently learning.

## Why Computer Science?

Technology is becoming more diverse and universal than ever. For example, there are now major crypto currencies. A few decades ago many people could have not ever imagined digital currency being a possibility. I want to be a part of the changing world. My passion for technology and the future makes a great reason for me to major in Computer Science. I want to make our current world more efficent, fun, and safer by using computer technology. This could mean many things. I could help build the first fully autonomous vechile, increase testing of medical equipment, mine cyrptos, make video games, and many other various possibilities that our mind can not even encapsulate at this time. I want to connect the world and all people using the technology at our disposal. The best thing about being part of the computer science field is that the possibilities are endless. WE can change the world forever!

## Projects By Courses
 The course will be listed and then a short description of the project(s) separated with an empty line
 
### CIS 162 (Computer Science 1) Summer 2020
Create a simulation of a phone and calculate the phone bill based on texting and data rates using java. Wifi could be enabled to not use data. Data rates started with a base fee and then additionals charges for each GB over. Data was consumed by streaming audio or videos.
 
Read and load a CSV file about covid data using java. Use the data inputted to show top 10 states with most cases overall or for a specific date. Also determined if a state was able to open based on continous days of declining cases.
   
### CIS 163 (Computer Science 2) Fall 2020
Create a simulation of 3 ATMs using java. Allow for depositing and withdrawal of money. Must ensure there is sufficent funds as well as sufficent bills for a withdrawal. Fail safe to turn off all 3 ATMs. Save and load ATMs for future use. Can also compare ATMs. 
     
Create and manage a game store using java. Rent games and/or consoles. Give an estimated cost based on rental date and return. When games and/or console is returned calculate actual payment and accept payment. Sort the renters data using streams and lambdas. A later modification changed sorting to be based on a double linked list without a tail.
     
### MTH 225 (Discrete Structures 1) Fall 2020
Use python and a juypter notebook to create code to follow given sequences such as arithmetic and geometric sequences. Start at a specifed index and end with another specifed index. This project also used recurrsion to determine if a given sequence would be k constant for a given sequence.
