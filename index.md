 ## Projects By Courses
 The course will be listed and then a sort description of the project
 
 ### CIS 162 (Computer Science 1) Summer 2020
Create a simulation of a phone and calculate the phone bill based on texting and data rates using java. Wifi could be enabled to not use data. Data rates started with a base fee and then additionals charges for each GB over. Data was consumed by streaming audio or videos.
 
Read and load a CSV file about covid data using java. Use the data inputted to show top 10 states with most cases overall or for a specific date. Also determined if a state was able to open based on continous days of declining cases.
   
### CIS 163 (Computer Science 2) Fall 2020
Create a simulation of 3 ATMs using java. Allow for depositing and withdrawal of money. Must ensure there is sufficent funds as well as sufficent bills for a withdrawal. Fail safe to turn off all 3 ATMs. Save and load ATMs for future use. Can also compare ATMs. 
     
Create and manage a game store using java. Rent games and/or consoles. Give an estimated cost based on rental date and return. When games and/or console is returned calculate actual payment and accept payment. Sort the renters data using streams and lambdas. A later modification changed sorting to be based on a double linked list without a tail.
     
### MTH 225 (Discrete Structures 1) Fall 2020
Use python and a juypter notebook to create code to follow given sequences such as arithmetic and geometric sequences. Start at a specifed index and end with another specifed index. This project also used recurrsion to determine if a given sequence would be k constant for a given sequence.
